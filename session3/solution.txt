special case: * f(x,u) = Ax + Bu
              * l(x,u) = 1/2(xTQx + uTRu)
              * Vf(x) = 1/2 xT Qf x
              * X = {x in R^n : Hx <= h}
              * U = {x in R^m: Gx <= g}


==> xN in Xf (plan to keep endpoint of horizon N to be in a control invariant set)
(control invariant set ==> set where i can keep state in with feasibel control actions)

==> Guarentee that the optimization problem will be feasible for all k


Xf = kindoff safety set
Vf(xN) = necessary for stabilizing the system (lyapunov stability)


Oef 1.
    if Xf in X 


Oef 2.
    Vinf(x) = lim N -> inf VN(x)
    V_LQR(x) = 1/2 xTPx P solves DARE
    ---------------------------------
    V_LQR <= Vinf (1)
    If K_inf "satisfies constraints"
    then (1) we have equality
    ---------------------------------
    Kinf(x) = Kx
    x in Xf
    ==>
    cases{
    * Kx in U for all x in Xf
    * (A+BK)x in Xf for all x in Xf
    }

    Xf = {x in X | (A+BK)x in Xf; Kx  in U} "recursive definition" ==> find Xf



3. Not constrain u to Kx ==> might get bigger terminal set

Approach ==> gives the maximal invariant set possible ( recursively feasible) But does not guarneteed the Vinf optimal cost infinite horizon
